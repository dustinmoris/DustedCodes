# Design, test and document RESTful APIs using RAML in .NET

Building a RESTful API is easy. Building a RESTful API which is easy to consume is more difficult. There are three key elements which make a good API:

-   Intuitive design
-   Good documentation
-   Documentation which actually matches the implementation

Intuitive API design is obviously very important, but equally important and often neglected is good and complete documentation which makes it easier to build against your API.

Having said that we all know how difficult it is to keep documentation up to date. It is very loosely coupled to the actual implementation without any enforcement other than a human trial and error process.

In this article I would like to demonstrate how we can close this gap by building a RESTful API with a design- and test first approach using [RAML](http://raml.org/).

I will showcase an entire end to end scenario by building a simple demo API and covering the following steps:

1.   [Design an API using RAML](#design-an-api-using-raml)
2.   [Generate a client from the RAML document](#generate-a-client-from-the-raml-document)
3.   [Write tests using the auto-generated client](#write-tests-using-the-auto-generated-client)
4.   [Implement the API to satisfay the tests](#implement-the-api-to-satisfy-the-tests)
5.   [Document and review an API using the Anypoint Platform](#document-and-review-an-api-using-the-anypoint-platform)

But first let me briefly introduce you to RAML:

## RAML

[RAML](http://raml.org/) stands for RESTful API Modeling Language and *this* is exactly what it delivers.

If you have worked with [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) or [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) before then this should be familiar, except that RAML is designed to be human readable and remarkably easy to use.

At the time of writing there are two public specifications:

-   [RAML 0.8](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-08/raml-08.md)
-   [RAML 1.0 RC](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md/)

In this blog post I will be using RAML 0.8 and assume that you are familiar enough with the spec to follow my simple examples as part of the demo.

For further reading I would recommend to go through the official RAML tutorials explaining the basic concepts and more advanced features in your own time and at your own pace:

-   [RAML 100 Tutorial (Basics)](http://raml.org/developers/raml-100-tutorial)
-   [RAML 200 Tutorial (Advanced)](http://raml.org/developers/raml-200-tutorial)

Now that you know what RAML is I will jump straight into the first part where I'll be using RAML to design an API:

<h2 id="design-an-api-using-raml">1. Design an API using RAML</h2>

As I mentioned earlier, for the purpose of this demo I would like to build a very rudimental fake parcel delivery API with the following endpoint:

-   ***GET** /status/{parcelId}* will return the status of a parcel
-   ***PUT** /status/{parcelId}* will update the status of a parcel

RAML is a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) based language and designed for human readability. The beauty of this is that you can write RAML in a basic editor without fancy syntax highlighting and it will be still easy to read and understand.

However, there is a good [Atom](https://atom.io/) plugin called [API Workbench](http://apiworkbench.com/) which I am using to kick start my API:

<pre><code>#%RAML 0.8
title: Parcel Delivery API
version: v1
baseUri: http://localhost/raml-demo-api/{version}
protocols: [ HTTP, HTTPS ]</code></pre>

*Sidenote:
I will not go through every single line of the sample code, but provide enough context so that it should be easy to follow.*

At the top of the document I specified the RAML version, followed by the title of the API, the API version and the basic URI with a version placeholder. This allows me to introduce breaking changes in the future. The API shall also be called from both protocols, HTTP and HTTPS.

Next I define a single endpoint to set and get status information for a given parcel ID:

<pre><code>...
/status/{parcelId}:
  displayName: Parcel Status Information
  uriParameters:
    parcelId:
      displayName: Parcel ID
      type: string
      required: true
      minLength: 6
      maxLength: 6
      example: 123456</code></pre>

After this I define the contract for the GET operation, which shall return the current status of a parcel:

<pre><code>...
  get:
    description: Retrieves the current status for the specified parcel ID.
    responses:
      200:
        description: Current status.
        body:
          application/json:
            schema: |
              {
                "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
                "title": "Delivery Status",
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "status": {
                    "description": "The current status of the delivery.",
                    "type": "string"
                  },
                  "updated": {
                    "description": "The date time the last status update.",
                    "type": "string"
                  }
                }
              }
            example: |
              {
                "status": "Parcel is out for delivery.",
                "updated": "2015-12-09T16:53:19.5168335+00:00"
              }</code></pre>

As you can see there is probably not much I have to explain. The GET operation returns a successful response with the 200 HTTP status code and a JSON payload containing the current status. Note how RAML allows me to provide an example alongside the schema. This will be particularly useful at a later point.

I am pleased with that and apply something similar for the PUT verb:

<pre><code>...
  put:
    description: Creates or updates the status for the specified parcel ID.
    body:
      application/json:
        schema: |
          {
            "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
            "title": "Status Update",
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "status": {
                "description": "The new status update message.",
                "type": "string"
              }
            }
          }
        example: |
          {
            "status": "Delivered and signed by customer."
          }
    responses:
      201:
        description: The status has been successfully updated.</code></pre>

The only difference is that the PUT operation expects a JSON object in the HTTP body and returns the [201 status code](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.2.2) on success.

Now I'm almost done with designing my API. The only thing missing is to describe what happens if a consumer provides an invalid parcel ID. It might either not exist or be in the wrong format.

Because this applies to both operations, the GET and the PUT on my endpoint, I will define a [trait](http://docs.raml.org/specs/1.0/#raml-10-spec-resource-types-and-traits) with two additional error responses, which can be shared by multiple endpoints in RAML:

<pre><code>...
traits:
  <strong>- requiresValidParcelId:</strong>
      usage: |
        Apply this to any method which requires a valid Parcel ID in the request.
      responses:
        406:
          description: Parcel ID was in incorrect format.
          body:
            application/json:
              <strong>schema: ErrorMessage</strong>
              example: |
                {
                  "message": "Parcel ID has to be 6 characters long and may only contain digits."
                }
        404:
          description: Could not find the specified parcel ID.
          body:
            application/json:
              <strong>schema: ErrorMessage</strong>
              example: |
                {
                  "message": "Parcel ID not found."
                }</code></pre>

Every trait has a unique name. In this case I called it `requiresValidParcelId`.

Perhaps you noticed the `schema: ErrorMessage` in the declaration of the response body. Shared schemas is another feature of RAML. I created an `ErrorMessage` schema to describe the JSON payload of an error response:

<pre><code>...
schemas:
  - ErrorMessage: |
      {
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
        "title": "Error Message",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "message": {
            "description": "The error message of the error.",
            "type": "string"
          }
        }
      }</code></pre>

Overall it is the same principle as to how I defined the success response in my previous example, except that this one is declared in a separate section which allows multiple re-use inside RAML.

At last I need to hook up my endpoint with the trait:

<pre><code>...
/status/{parcelId}:
  displayName: Parcel Status Information
  uriParameters:
    parcelId:
      displayName: Parcel ID
      type: string
      required: true
      minLength: 6
      maxLength: 6
      example: 123456
  <strong>is: [ requiresValidParcelId ]</strong></code></pre>

The entire end result looks as follows:

<pre><code>#%RAML 0.8
title: Parcel Delivery API
version: v1
baseUri: https://raml-demo-api.azurewebsites.net/{version}
protocols: [ HTTP, HTTPS ]
schemas:

        "title": "Error Message",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "message": {
            "description": "The error message of the error.",
            "type": "string"
          }
        }
      }
traits:
  - requiresValidParcelId:
      usage: |
        Apply this to any method which requires a valid Parcel ID in the request.
      responses:
        406:
          description: Parcel ID was in an incorrect format.
          body:
            application/json:

                  "message": "Parcel ID has to be 6 characters long and may only contain digits."
                }

*You can also explore the full [RAML document](https://github.com/dustinmoris/RAML-Demo/blob/master/api.raml) in my [RAML-Demo](https://github.com/dustinmoris/RAML-Demo/) GitHub repository.*

RAML has a lot more to offer than what I showed in this basic example, but hopefully this gives you a rough idea of how intuitive and powerful it can be!

Additionally there is a lot of useful tooling built around RAML. One of my favourites is the RAML Tools for .NET, which brings me to the second part of this blog post.

<h2 id="generate-a-client-from-the-raml-document">2. Generate a client from the RAML document</h2>

Now that I have a detailed specification of what my API should look like it is time to open up Visual Studio and get my hands dirty.

First I create an empty test project and include the RAML file (api.raml) in a solution folder to keep everything together:

<img src="https://cdn.dusted.codes/images/blog-posts/2015-12-23/23265040193_87ebcfdf49_o.png" alt="RAML-Demo-Solution-Tree, Image by Dustin Moris Gorski">

For the next part I have to install the [RAML Tools for .NET](https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-dotnet-tools) Visual Studio extension:

<img src="https://cdn.dusted.codes/images/blog-posts/2015-12-23/23865723396_88003023fd_o.png" alt="RAML-Demo-Visual-Studio-RAML-Extension, Image by Dustin Moris Gorski">

After a successful install I have an additional context menu when I right click the &quot;References&quot; item underneath my test project:

<img src="https://cdn.dusted.codes/images/blog-posts/2015-12-23/23596120010_2895ee90f2_o.png" alt="RAML-Demo-Add-RAML-Reference, Image by Dustin Moris Gorski">

A click on that menu item pops up a pretty much self-explaining dialog:

<img src="https://cdn.dusted.codes/images/blog-posts/2015-12-23/23783503252_f6263a16ef_o.png" alt="RAML-Demo-Add-RAML-Reference-Dialog, Image by Dustin Moris Gorski">

I select the Upload option and navigate to the api.raml inside my solution folder. After confirmation I am presented with an Import RAML dialog:

<img src="https://cdn.dusted.codes/images/blog-posts/2015-12-23/23865723466_db487ddba7_o.png" alt="RAML-Demo-Create-Client, Image by Dustin Moris Gorski">

The import process automatically detected my single endpoint and the only thing I had to change was the default client name to &quot;ParcelDeliveryApiClient&quot; in case I want to import another API at a later point.

Hitting the Import button finishes the remaining work and once completed I am seeing a new API reference in my project tree:

<img src="https://cdn.dusted.codes/images/blog-posts/2015-12-23/23596119830_abde113f83_o.png" alt="RAML-Demo-RAML-References-in-Project, Image by Dustin Moris Gorski">

This was a very smooth and painless process and if successfully imported I should be able to create an instance of `ParcelDeliveryApiClient` in a new class file:

<img src="https://cdn.dusted.codes/images/blog-posts/2015-12-23/23797380272_a633140864_o.png" alt="RAML-Demo-Aut-Generated-Client-in-Code, Image by Dustin Moris Gorski">

Amazing, let's explore the auto-generated client by writing some tests in the next step!

<h2 id="write-tests-using-the-auto-generated-client">3. Write tests using the auto-generated client</h2>

With the `ParcelDeliveryApiClient` I can write integration tests against a real endpoint. At the moment I don't have a working API running anywhere so I define a provisional URI and a couple more parameters for my first test:

<pre><code>[TestFixture]
public class ParcelDeliveryApiTests
{
    [Test]
    public async Task IntegrationTest()
    {
        const string endpoint = "http://localhost/raml-demo-api/v1/status";
        const string parcelId = "123456";
        const string status = "Parcel is out for delivery.";
    }
}</code></pre>

Next I initialize the client and send a PUT request for the parcel ID 123456:

<pre><code>[Test]
public async Task IntegrationTest1()
{
    const string endpoint = "http://localhost/raml-demo-api/v1/status";
    const string parcelId = "123456";
    const string status = "Parcel is out for delivery.";

    <strong>var parcelDeliveryApiClient = new ParcelDeliveryApiClient(endpoint);

    var putResult =
        await parcelDeliveryApiClient.StatusParcelId.Put(
            new StatusParcelIdPutRequestContent
            {
                Status = status
            },
            parcelId);</strong>
}</code></pre>

The amazing thing is that the entire client code has been auto-generated during the import. Every member of the class such as the `StatusParcelId` or the `Put(...)` method, as well as the `StatusParcelIdPutRequestContent` DTO class have been auto-magically created for me.

Remember, all I have done so far was to describe my API using RAML and with a few additional clicks in Visual Studio I am now able to write full fletched integration tests against an API which doesn't even exist yet!

I find this pretty cool.

The expected result is HTTP status code 201:

<pre><code>[Test]
public async Task IntegrationTest()
{
    const string endpoint = "http://localhost/raml-demo-api/v1/status";
    const string parcelId = "123456";
    const string status = "Parcel is out for delivery.";

    var parcelDeliveryApiClient = new ParcelDeliveryApiClient(endpoint);

    var putResult =
        await parcelDeliveryApiClient.StatusParcelId.Put(
            new StatusParcelIdPutRequestContent
            {
                Status = status
            },
            parcelId);

    <strong>Assert.AreEqual(HttpStatusCode.Created, putResult.StatusCode);</strong>
}</code></pre>

For this integration test I'd like to add one more check:

<pre><code>[Test]
public async Task IntegrationTest()
{
    const string endpoint = "http://localhost/raml-demo-api/v1/status";
    const string parcelId = "123456";
    const string status = "Parcel is out for delivery.";

    var parcelDeliveryApiClient = new ParcelDeliveryApiClient(endpoint);

    var putResult =
        await parcelDeliveryApiClient.StatusParcelId.Put(
            new StatusParcelIdPutRequestContent
            {
                Status = status
            },
            parcelId);

    Assert.AreEqual(HttpStatusCode.Created, putResult.StatusCode);

    <strong>var getResult = await parcelDeliveryApiClient.StatusParcelId.Get(parcelId);

    Assert.AreEqual(HttpStatusCode.OK, getResult.StatusCode);
    Assert.AreEqual(status, getResult.Content.StatusParcelIdGetOKResponseContent.Status);</strong>
}</code></pre>

After the PUT I am firing a GET with the same parcel ID and expect another successful response with the updated status.

When I run this test it will fail on the first assertion, because at the moment there is nothing behind the endpoint yet, but I am going to fix this very soon.

This test obviously doesn't cover everything from the RAML document, but at this point it should be clear that with the auto-generated client I can test every single aspect of my API without having to write any client code myself.

### Coupling the RAML file to the API

So how is this better than a normal integration test? The key benefit is that the client is a 1:1 replica of the RAML file. If the API changes I will have to update my tests, which requires me to update the client, which subsequently forces me to update the RAML first.

Besides that it took me only 10 seconds to generate a perfect abstraction of my API which can be used for more than just writing tests.

<h2 id="implement-the-api-to-satisfy-the-tests">4. Implement the API to satisfy the tests</h2>

I have to admit this part has very little to do with RAML, but I thought it would be great to provide a full end to end example as part of this blog post.

For that reason I'll make it short and fast forward the implementation to the point where it will satisfy the test from above:

<pre><code>public StatusModule() : base("/v1/status")
{
    Get["/{parcelId}"] = ctx =>
    {
        if (!Statuses.ContainsKey(ctx.parcelId))
            return HttpStatusCode.NotFound;

        return new JsonResponse(
            Statuses[ctx.parcelId],
            new DefaultJsonSerializer());
    };

    Put["/{parcelId}"] = ctx =>
    {
        dynamic obj = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(Request.Body.AsString());

        Statuses[ctx.parcelId] = new StatusInformation
        {
            Status = obj.status.Value,
            Updated = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("o")
        };

        return HttpStatusCode.Created;
    };
}</code></pre>

This (quick and dirty) snippet doesn't implement the entire API, but enough to make the test go green.

After cheating myself through step 4 let's move on to the next and final part of this article and look at another important criteria of building a RESTful API.

<h2 id="document-and-review-an-api-using-the-anypoint-platform">5. Document and review an API using the Anypoint Platform</h2>

Before going any further let's quickly recap what I've done so far:

-   I designed an API using RAML
-   Used the RAML Tools for .NET to auto-generate a client
-   Wrote an integration test with the generated client
-   Implemented enough of the API to satisfy my test

It feels like I am almost done. So what about documentation? Well RAML is already human readable, it is accurate and tested against my actual API and all my tests are passing as well, so am I actually done?

No, not yet, there are two more things I have to solve:

-   At the moment the RAML document is only in my source control and likely not accessible to external consumers
-   Integration tests are great to give me confidence, but my stakeholders don't understand those green and red lights in Visual Studio (or CI system) and likely want to verify the API for themselves

This is where I find the [Anypoint Platform](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/) extremely useful!

### Anypoint Platform

Among many other features [Anypoint](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/) allows me to document and publish my API with an interactive designer (much like the API Workbench but even richer) and create a live Portal at no cost.

The designer is exceptionally well done. It offers many features like syntax highlighting, intellisense, instant RAML validation and auto-suggestion of available nodes:

Another brilliant feature is the interactive preview when editing a RAML file. It visually displays every characteristic of your API in a beautiful interface, like those responses as an example:

It even goes as far as allowing me to interact with a mocked service while working on the RAML:

When I click the Try It button it displays me a form with all relevant parameters pre-populated with the values from the examples in my RAML:

From the UI I can quickly run requests against my API with as little friction as possible.

Finally you can publish your API into a Live Portal which is publicly accessible (can be private as well), where users and stakeholders can try the API in a live environment.

Try it yourself by executing some PUT and GET requests via the [Live Portal of my demo API](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/dustinmoris#/portals/organizations/1c966d9b-793c-46bc-a87a-427b9a4a9b4a/apis/45625/versions/47291).

Any technical or non-technical person can review the API and validate if it works as expected and I as a developer cannot claim that a feature is done before it is available in the Live Portal.

This is how I envision API development in an agile environment.
