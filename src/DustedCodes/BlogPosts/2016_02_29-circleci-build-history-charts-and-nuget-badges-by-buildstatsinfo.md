# CircleCI build history charts and NuGet badges by Buildstats.info

Quick update on [Buildstats.info](https://buildstats.info/). Two weeks ago I added [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) to the list of  supported CI systems for the [build history chart](https://github.com/dustinmoris/CI-BuildStats#build-history-chart) and last weekend I implemented a new badge for [NuGet packages](https://github.com/dustinmoris/CI-BuildStats#nuget-badge) too.

CircleCI is the third continuous integration system which is supported by the build history chart now. AppVeyor and TravisCI are the other two. If you have a public open source project which is built by one of those systems then you might want to check out the official [documentation for the build history chart](https://github.com/dustinmoris/CI-BuildStats). Its quite cool and lets you create SVG badges like the one I did for my blog:

<a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dustinmoris/dustedcodes/history?branch=master" title="dusted.codes build history"><img src="https://buildstats.info/appveyor/chart/dustinmoris/dustedcodes?branch=master" alt="Build History Chart" /></a>

On a complete separate note I also added a new SVG badge for [NuGet packages](https://github.com/dustinmoris/CI-BuildStats#nuget-badge).

I did not think of adding NuGet support in the beginning, but since [Shields.io](http://shields.io/) NuGet badges are broken for more than 2 weeks now I had to look for an alternative:

The [issue has been reported](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/655), but it doesn't look like it will get fixed any time soon and so I went with my own solution.

For my personal projects I like to display the current version of my NuGet packages as well as the total number of downloads. With Shields.io I had to use two individual badges, but with Buildstats.info I can display both in one:

<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lanem/" title="Lanem NuGet package"><img src="https://buildstats.info/nuget/lanem" alt="NuGet badge for Lanem" /></a>

This is a first version which satisfied my own personal needs, but will likely expand over the next coming weeks providing more functionality for other users as well.

I have a few ideas, but if you are looking for something in particular then please feel free to [file a feature request](https://github.com/dustinmoris/CI-BuildStats/issues) on the public GitHub repository.
