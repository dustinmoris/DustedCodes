My personal website - an Open Source ASP.NET MVC 5 Blog.

# About

Inspired by GitHub Pages and Jekyll this is a C# blog engine which renders static HTML pages.

Blog articles can be written in either Markdown or HTML. Markdown pages get compiled into static HTML pages at build time.

Feel free to fork it and create your own nerdy space in the world wide web!
